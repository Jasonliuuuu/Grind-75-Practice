# Grind 75 Practice

Welcome to my **Grind 75 Practice** repository! This repository contains my solutions, explanations, and progress while tackling the **Grind 75** problems. These problems are carefully curated to help prepare for technical coding interviews by covering a wide range of important data structures, algorithms, and problem-solving techniques.

## üìå About Grind 75

[Grind 75](https://www.grind75.com/) is a collection of 75 carefully selected coding problems designed to systematically build your problem-solving and coding skills. It is widely used by software engineers to prepare for technical interviews.

The problems are grouped by difficulty and concepts, ranging from beginner-friendly to advanced topics, including:
- Arrays and Strings
- Linked Lists
- Trees and Graphs
- Dynamic Programming
- Backtracking
- Greedy Algorithms
- Bit Manipulation
- And more!

## üìÇ Repository Structure

This repository is organized into folders, each representing a problem from Grind 75:


### Folder Contents:
- **`solution.<language>`:** My implementation of the problem in the programming language of choice (e.g., C++, Python).
- **`explanation.md:`** A detailed explanation of the problem, the thought process, and the solution.
- **`test_cases.txt:`** Example test cases used to validate the solution.
